                <p>
                    Cán Tỷ kindergarten is a small school located in Cán Tỷ village, inside Quản Bạ town in Hà Giang. The school is struggling to maintain itself under difficult conditions in the remote areas of Hà Giang. Unlike the freshening weather of the capital, Hà Giang constantly has to suffer from freezing cold weather that would inscribe on the mind of any visitors. Extreme weather combined with the ongoing pandemic has made maintaining the school more back-breaking than ever. With the premise “Giving is receiving,” Charible wants to put in some effort and dedicate the achievement of our newborn model to improve the infrastructure as well as the teaching quality of this school.
                    Charible’s first goal is to raise 15 million VND through our paintings and trading of our NFTs on Opensea. The money raised will be used to supply the school with the classroom stationeries and equipment needed for a better education.</p>

                <p>On the 20th of June, we made our way to the Can Ty kindergarten located at Quan Ba town, Ha Giang province to deliver the love and support of us and all of our supporters throughout the last four months. We brought along many items and appliances such as water purifier, shelves, toys,...to improve the learning conditions of all the teachers and students here. As we relay the tremendous love that we and all of yous guys have cultivated for not quite a long time but a very meaningful period to us, we are very delighted and euphoric that our small and humble effort has brought about a better learning condition for the forever smiles on the cheeks of the adorable kids here.</p>
